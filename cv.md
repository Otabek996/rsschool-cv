### Code example:

**Fibonacci Number:**
*The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from `0` and `1`. That is, `F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1` <br> `F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1`. Given `n`, calculate `F(n)`.*

```javascript
var fib = function(n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return n;
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
};
```
